## About Me

- I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.
- My past research interests included building robust robotic manipulation systems to perform complex tasks with multisensory data, and I did research in the [Robotics: Perception and Manipulation Lab](https://rpm-lab.github.io) at the University of Minnesota.
- Last summer, I was at the [WashU CSE REU](https://sites.wustl.edu/csereu/) doing research on reinforcement learning for autonomous driving in realistic urban environments.

I will be starting a PhD in Computer Science at Rice University in Fall 2025, working in the [Human-Centered AI and Robotics Group](https://unhelkar.github.io/group/)!
