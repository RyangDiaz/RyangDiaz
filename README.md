Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying computer science and math at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. My current research interests include building robust robotic manipulation systems to perform complex tasks with multisensory data, and I currently do research in the [Robotics: Perception and Manipulation Lab](https://rpm-lab.github.io) at the University of Minnesota. This past summer, I was at the [WashU CSE REU](https://sites.wustl.edu/csereu/) doing research on reinforcement learning for autonomous driving in realistic urban environments. Iâ€™m always trying to explore new ways to help robots do cool things!

I will be starting a PhD in Computer Science at Rice University in Fall 2025, working in the [Human-Centered AI and Robotics Group](https://unhelkar.github.io/group/)!
